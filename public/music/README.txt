MUSIC FOLDER
=============

Add your background music files here as MP3 files.

Required files (you can rename them or edit src/utils/musicPlayer.ts):
- track1.mp3
- track2.mp3
- track3.mp3
- track4.mp3
- track5.mp3

The music will loop automatically through all tracks.

Recommended:
- Use ambient, electronic, or lo-fi music
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 10MB each)
- Use 128-192kbps MP3 for good quality/size balance

If you don't have music files yet, you can:
1. Use royalty-free music from sites like:
   - FreePD.com
   - Incompetech.com
   - Bensound.com
   - YouTube Audio Library

2. Or remove/comment out tracks in src/utils/musicPlayer.ts
   until you have music files ready.

The game will work fine without music - it just won't play anything
when you click the music button.
